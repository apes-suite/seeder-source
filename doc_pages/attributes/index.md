title: Attribute

Attribute defines the property for the geometries defined in the spatial object. 
Following attribute kinds are supported:

- [Boundary](boundary.html)
- [Seed](seed.html)
- [Refinement](refinement.html)

Attribute list is dynamic unique list. Thus multiple definitions of the same attribute in the configuration file does not result in multiple storages.
